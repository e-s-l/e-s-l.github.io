Also plan on linking a neocities site.

**************************************

### To Do:

This is a perpetual work in progress, so there will always be lots to do...
But to name some of them:

<ul>
    <li> Dither the images (to reduce file size): c.f. doodad.dev/dither-me-this/
    <li> Make text color complement back ground color (4 accessibility)
    <li> Media Queries for mobile friendly design... Also need to account for light/dark themes... </li>
    <li> Add an 'official' CV... </li>
</ul>
