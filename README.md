Now using Jekyll with the XXX theme, to focus on the content...

## about

This is a clone of the minimalist theme, found [here](https://trybnetic.github.io/minimalist/), with small adjustments.

## TODO

- though it works on github pages, it fails to build locally...
- starting filling it out.
- modify the theme so it ain't so generic.
- set up a work flow.
    - soft links the `_posts` to somewhere more accessible.
